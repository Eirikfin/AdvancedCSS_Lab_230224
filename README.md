## Exercise - Recreate Layouts using BEM
In this exercise, you will work in pairs of two and further practice using BEM. 

1. Get into groups of two.

2. One person in the group will Fork the repository from GitHub and download it to your local machine. Share the forked GitHub project with your partner, as you will be working in the same repository. Open the repository in your preferred text editor (for example VSCode).

3. In groups of two, you will recreate the two attached photos retrieved from Finn.no using HTML & CSS with BEM. You are only going to recreate the layout, it does not have to be functional. You will find the images under the "**img**" folder.

4. As you are in pairs, each group member will be responsible for recreating **one** of the images. Collaboratively decide which image each of you will recreate.

5. You will need to create a new feature branch when working on a specific functionality or section. After creating a new element, try to commit and push the changes to GitHub, and create a pull request for that branch before creating a new branch for the next feature. Please look for merge conflicts and try to solve them before continuing. 
   
6. After you have finished recreating one of the images using BEM, you will give feedback to each other by commenting on the pull requests created by your partner. Review each other's completed tasks, engaging in a discussion. Provide constructive feedback, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement in relation to BEM.
