## Exercise - BEM
In this exercise, you will work in pairs of two and further practice using BEM. 

1. In group of two, you are going to recreate the two attached photos retrieved from Finn.no using BEM. You will find the images under the **img** folder.
_Tips! You are going to use the documentation on [Get BEM](https://getbem.com/) to understand and retrieve information to properly implement the correct naming conventions.
_
3. As you are in pairs, each group member will be responsible for recreating **one** of the images. Collaboratively decide which image each of you will recreate.
   
4. After you have finished recreating one of the images using BEM, you are going to show or "swap" your codebase with your partner.

5. Together, review each other's completed tasks, engaging in a discussion. Provide constructive feedback to your partner focusing on both strengths and areas for improvement in relation to BEM."
