## Exercise - BEM
In this exercise, you will work in pairs of two and further practice using BEM. 

1. Get into groups of two.

2. Fork the repository from GitHub, and download it to your local machine.

3. In groups of two, you are going to recreate the two attached photos retrieved from Finn.no using HTML & CSS with BEM. You are only going to recreate the layout, it does not have to be functional. You will find the images under the "**img**" folder.

4. As you are in pairs, each group member will be responsible for recreating **one** of the images. Collaboratively decide which image each of you will recreate.
   
5. After you have finished recreating one of the images using BEM, you are going to show or "swap" your codebase with your partner.

6. Review each other's completed tasks, engaging in a discussion. Provide constructive feedback to your partner, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement in relation to BEM.

Tips! Use the documentation on [Get BEM](https://getbem.com/) to implement the correct naming conventions properly.
