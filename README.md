## Exercise - Recreate Layouts using BEM
In this exercise, you will work in pairs of two and further practice using BEM. 

1. Get into groups of two.

2. One person in the group will [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the repository from GitHub and download it to your local machine. Share the forked GitHub project with your partner, as you will be working in the same repository. Open the repository in your preferred text editor (for example VSCode).

3. In groups of two, you will recreate the two attached photos retrieved from Finn.no using HTML & CSS with BEM. You are only going to recreate the layout, it does not have to be functional. You will find the images under the "**img**" folder.

4. As you are in pairs, each group member will be responsible for recreating **one** of the images. Collaboratively decide which image each of you will recreate.

5. You will need to create your own working branch when working on your specific functionality or section. After creating a new element, try to commit and push changes to GitHub. 
   
6. After you have finished recreating one of the images using BEM, create a pull request for your partner to review.  

7. Review each other's completed tasks, engaging in a discussion. Provide constructive feedback to your partner, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement in relation to BEM.
